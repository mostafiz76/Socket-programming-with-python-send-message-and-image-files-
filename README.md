Sending msg and image data between machines via sockets

Recently I was working with socket programming and I was amazed to learn how we can communicate between 2 machines placed remotely. With sockets, not only communicating we can send/receive any kind of data including images. So I thought of sharing this knowledge with you all. 

This Repo contains 4 files:
1. client_script.py - recieves text msg from server
2. client_img.py -  recieves and displays image
3. server_script.py - sends text to client
4. server_img.py - sends imgage data to client
